# code-refactor2


## Description
The goal of this project was to refactor the codebase such that it meets accessibility standards. The following updates were made to the index.html and css stylesheet: changed the various div tags to their semantic equivalent; added alt attributes to the images;updated the title; and consolidated classes to minimize the number of lines in the css stylesheet.
